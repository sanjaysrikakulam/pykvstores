# pykvstores
* pykvstores is a Python package for key-value store management.
* Provides a set of key-value store implementations using different backends like LMDB, [Pyarrow's plasma](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/plasma.html), [Ray's plasma](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/actors.html).
* The key-value store implementations offer a unified interface and a dictionary-like access to the key-value stores.
* The key-value store implementations are multi-process safe.
* Refer [wiki](https://github.com/sanjaysrikakulam/pykvstores/wiki) for documentation and how to use
